# NodeShellServer

NodeJS based persistent, unstoppable and secure Shell Server providing RESTful 
services to commands.

While working with many projects, I came across a requirement when I needed to 
keep a secure shell access to a server for running commands but via REST so that
an web application can be built for doing certain tasks.

It started as a minor project, but then quickly grew to include a lot many tasks.
I have tried to have too many dependency, not that its a problem, just to keep the
project small and agile. Deploying it needs just one library.
